**Cyanotypes- &nbsp;a very brief intro**<br>Cyanotypes were Invented by John Herschel in 1841 and then made popular by Anna Atkins who was a photographer and botanist.<br>It was a low-cost process to produce copies of drawings for engineers well into the 20 century â€“ commonly known as blue-prints. This process was popular in Victorian England but as the photographic process became more sophisticated the photogram/cyan print became used mainly by artists.<br>Made by combining two chemicals: Ferric ammonium citrate (a green powder) and potassium ferricyanide (red crystals). This substance when mixed is sensitive to ultraviolet light (sunlight), the results are Prussian blueprints.<br>&nbsp;
