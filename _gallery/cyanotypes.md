    During my workshops you will learn about the process of this beautiful,
    magical blue Cyanotypes. We will explore the fauna and flora of green
    spaces, choose and design prints using flowers, leaves, grasses, bits and
    bobs. You will never look at a weed in the same way again!


    Sometimes my workshops are outside in woodlands or allotments, sometimes
    within coffee shops or inside spaces. Wherever they are I hope to bring to
    you a relaxing, and creative environment for discovery!&nbsp;


    Next workshop is in the beautiful Lawrence Art Studio in Hove, Brighton.

    **Cyanotypes – a very brief intro**


    Cyanotypes were Invented by British Astrologer **Sir John Herschel**
    (1792-1871) in 1841. He was trying to find a way to duplicate his notes.


    Herschel managed to fix pictures using hyposulphite of soda as early as
    1839.


    The cyanotype process was a low-cost method to produce copies of drawings
    for engineers well into the 20 century – commonly known as blueprints.


    He also invented the words photography, negative, positive, and snapshot!


    This process was popular in Victorian England but as the photographic
    process became more sophisticated the photogram/cyan print was used mainly
    by artists.


    **&nbsp;Anna Atkins**, British Photographer and botanist helped to bring the
    process its popularity. She was the first person to produce an illustrated
    book (British Algae: Cyanotype impressions - 1843) using photographic
    illustrations, back then they were known as shadowgraphs.


    In modern times we make cyanotypes by combining two chemicals: Ferric
    ammonium citrate (a green powder) and potassium ferricyanide (red crystals).
    This substance when mixed is sensitive to ultraviolet light (sunlight). Once
    exposed the paper is then simply rinsed off and settled in water resulting
    in Prussian blue prints.
