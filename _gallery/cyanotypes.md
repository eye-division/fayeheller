title: Cyanotypes workshops
description_markdown: >-
    Next workshop Plot 22 - 13th March 11am - 1pm. Tickets will be avaliable on
    Plot 22 website. More dates will be published asap


    Create fascinating cyanotype prints with camera-less photography. Using
    light sensitive papers, we will create beautiful and unique cyan prints. You
    will learn about cyan prints and go home with your very own creations.


    Cyan prints are created using the sun. After selecting your leaves, flowers,
    grasses, objects, the sun will do its job and you will wash the paper off in
    water. See what you can create\!


    “What a full rounded positive learning experience with great company, a
    clear and lovely Tutor and an amazing washing line of inspired, unique and
    quite ethereal nature prints at the end.”


    “A great taster and introduction to the techniques and now I’m keen to
    explore it more. “

    **Cyanotypes – a very brief intro**


    Cyanotypes were Invented by John Herschel in 1841 and then made popular by
    Anna Atkins who was a photographer and botanist.


    It was a low-cost process to produce copies of drawings for engineers well
    into the 20 century – commonly known as blue-prints. This process was
    popular in Victorian England but as the photographic process became more
    sophisticated the photogram/cyan print became used mainly by artists.


    Made by combining two chemicals: Ferric ammonium citrate (a green powder)
    and potassium ferricyanide (red crystals). This substance when mixed is
    sensitive to ultraviolet light (sunlight), the results are Prussian
    blueprints.
