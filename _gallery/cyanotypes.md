    **Cyanotypes – a very brief intro**


    Cyanotypes were Invented by John Herschel in 1841 and then made popular by
    Anna Atkins who was a photographer and botanist.


    It was a low-cost process to produce copies of drawings for engineers well
    into the 20 century – commonly known as blue-prints. This process was
    popular in Victorian England but as the photographic process became more
    sophisticated the photogram/cyan print became used mainly by artists.


    Made by combining two chemicals: Ferric ammonium citrate (a green powder)
    and potassium ferricyanide (red crystals). This substance when mixed is
    sensitive to ultraviolet light (sunlight), the results are Prussian
    blueprints.
