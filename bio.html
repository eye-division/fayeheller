    <p>Create fascinating cyanotype prints with camera-less photography. Using light sensitive papers, we will create beautiful and unique cyan prints. You will learn about cyan prints and go home with your very own creations.</p>
    <p>Cyan prints are created using the sun. After selecting your leaves, flowers, grasses, objects, the sun will do its job and you will wash the paper off in water. See what you can create!</p>
    <p>New workshop at the beautiful Lawrence Art Studio space in Hove, Brighton in May 2023</p>
